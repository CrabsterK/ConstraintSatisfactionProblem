# ConstraintSatisfactionProblem

The aim of the task was to get acquainted with the basic algorithms used for solving Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP), by implementation and examination of their properties.
The problem of N-hetmans and the Latin square was defined as a CSP problem and solved
using forward-check and backtracking algorithm for different values ​​of N (where N defines the size of the problem).

Problem was solved in four independent classes.
